# Unit 1: Univariate Data

## Definitions

### Data

facts or measurements that are collect, analyze, and interpret —— raw material of statistical analysis can be quantitative and qualitative

- **Cross-Sectional** - collected at the same time
- **Longitudinal** - time-series collected over several time periods

**Data Set** - all the data, across observations and variables

### Variable

may assume different values

- **Discrete** - can be counted —— takes on integer values
- **Continuous** - if interval is between a and b, variable can take any value in between

**Constant** - remains the same

### Elements

an element is a unit of data, which is represented as a a set of attributes or measurements  —— entities on which data are collected

**Observation** - set of values for the variables for an element set of measurements for a single data entity

### Population

all entities of interest in an investigative study

**Population parameters** - characteristics or quantities of the population

**Probability** - when we draw a sample for a population with known parameters

### Measurement of Variables

- **Nominal Level** - sometimes called “categorical”
- **Ordinal Level** - order is meaningful
- **Interval Level** - interval between the values is fixed
- **Ratio Level** - zero has meaning

Sample - subset of the population

Sample Statistics - characteristics or qualities of the sample

### Statistics

- **Descriptive** - describe data that have been collected
- **Inferential** - use data that have been collected to generalize or make inference based on it

Univariate distributions - explore how the collection of values for each variable is distributed across an array of possible values

use tables and graphs to capture the information

## Distributions

- axes
- step size
- shape
- range / spread
- center
- unusual / gaps and outliers

### Normal Distribution

- symmetry
- median = mean
- bell shape

### Center

- Normal Distribution
    - $\Mu$ = population mean = $\sum x_i / N$
    - $\bar{x}$ = sample mean = $\sum x_i / n$
- Skewed Data
    - Median  / exact middle / 50% percentile / middle quartile

### Unusual

- Normal Distribution
    - Gap
    - **Outliers** - 3 standard deviations away from the mean - 68% / 95% / 99%
- Skewed Data
    - **Outliers** - $Q_{75} + 1.5 \times IQR$ and $Q_{25} - 1.5 \times IQR$

### Spread

- Normal Distribution

    $$
    \sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i-M)^2}{N}}
    $$

    $$
    s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i-M)^2}{n-1}}
    $$

    $$
    range = max - min
    $$

- Skew Data
    - **IQR** - difference between the third and first quartile = $Q_{75}-Q_{25}$

### Shape

- normal
- uniform
- skew
    - less on left = negative skew / left skew
    - less on right = positive skew / right skew

### Percentile

**percentile** - way of measuring relative position within a data set

The raw score where a certain percentage of score fell below that number

**percentile rank** - relative position within a given dataset

$Rank = \dfrac{\text{percentile}}{100} * (\text{number of items} +1)$

### Modal

**unimodal** - have one mode

**symmetric unimodal** - mean = median = mode

**bimodal** - have two mode / peak

### Non-skewed normal-like

**center** - mean

**spread** - standard deviation - on average how far the data is from the mean

median, IQR - **Resistant Statistics**

mean, standard deviation - **Non-Resistant Statistics**

spread ≈ variability ≈ dispersion ≈ heterogeneity ≈ unpredictability

range ≈ IQR ≈ standard deviation ≈ variance

### Skewness

$$
Skewness=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^3/N}{(\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i-M)^2}{n-1}})^3}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar x)^3/N}{(\text{standard deviation})^3}
$$

$$
Standard\space Error\space Skewness=\sqrt{\frac{6N(N-1)}{(N-2)(N+1)(N+3)}}
$$

$$
Skew\space Ratio=\frac{\text{Skewness}}{\text{Standard Error Skewness}}
$$

- When a distribution is positively skewed, the skewness is positive.
- When a distribution is negatively skewed, the skewness is negative.
- When a distribution symmetric, the skewness is 0.
- When you have 2 or more distributions and you want to compare skewness, you use skewness ratio.
- By convention when the skewness ratio exceed 2 we consider the distribution highly skewed.

## Transformations

### Linear Transformation

$$
X_{new}=k X_{old}+C\space \ \ \textrm{where} \ \ \textrm{k and C are constants} \ and \ k\neq 0
$$

**Center**

$$
Range_{new} = |k|\space Range_{old}
$$

$$
\bar X_{new} = k \bar X_{old} + C
$$

$$
X_{new (median)} = k X_{old (median)} + C
$$

**Spread**

$$
IQR_{new} = |k|\space IQR_{old}
$$

$$
Sd_{new} = |k|\space Sd_{old}
$$

$$
Variance_{new} = k^2\space Variance_{old}
$$

**Shape**

$$
Skew_{new} = \frac{k}{|k|} Skew_{old}
$$

$$
Skew.ratio_{new} = \frac{k}{|k|} Skew.ratio_{old}
$$

### Z-score

$$
Z-Score_{i}=\frac{x_i-\bar x}{sd}
$$

### Nonlinear Transformation

- retains the order
- changes the relative distances between the values in the distribution, and, in doing so, impacts spread and shape

# Unit 2: Bivariate Data

### Bivariate Data

- two variables
- usually comparing at least interval type data
- does one variable relate to another, if so, how?
    - shape: linear / non-linear
    - direction: postiive, negative
    - strength: $r = \frac{\sum z_x\times z_y}{N-1}$
- correlation $\neq$ causation

1. obtain data - 2 variables (above nominal)
2. scatterplot
3. scale your data, fit a regression line
4. look at correlation
5. describe shape, direction, and strength

### Correlation Coefficient

$$
-1\leq r\leq 1
$$

- $\geq0.7$ - strong
- $[0.4,0.7)$ - moderate
- $<0.4$ - weak

### Linear Regression

line of best fit is obtained by minimizing the square of deviations to all points on the scatter plot

$$
\text{regression line}\equiv \text{prediction line}
$$

$$
D=\sqrt{\frac{\sum d_i^2}{N}} \ \ \textrm{where} \ \  d_i=y_i - \hat y(i)
$$

deviation also called residual

$$
\hat y = ax+b \ \ \textrm{where} \ \ a=r\frac{s_y}{s_x} \ \textrm{and} \ b=\bar y - a \bar x
$$

### $r^2$ Interpretation

$r^2=p\%$ means that the independent variable accounts for $p\%$ of the change in dependent variable

# Unit 3: Probability

### Definitions

**simple experiment** - any action (flipping a coin, choosing a card) that leads to one of several possible outcomes

**events** - observable outcomes

$$
P(E)=\frac{\text{number of outcomes that satisfy condition}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}
$$

If we only have two outcomes that are mutually exclusive, they are called **complements**.

$$
\textstyle P(\bigcup E_i)=\sum P(E_i) \ \ \text{if events have no shared symbol}
$$

$$
\textstyle P(\bigcup E_i)=\sum P(E_i) - P(\bigcap E_i)
$$

Suppose $E_i$ are independent of each other

$$
\textstyle P(\bigcap E_i)=\prod P(E_i)
$$

### Conditional Probability

- two events not independent of each other
- determining probability of an event happening given that another has happened

$$
P(E_1|E_2)=\frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2)}{P(E_2)}
$$

### The Law of Total Probability

$$
P(E_1)=P(E_1|E_2) \times P(E_2)+P(E_1|E_2^c) \times P(E_2^c)
$$

### Bayes’ Theorem

$$
P(E_1|E_2)=\frac{P(E_2|E_1) \times P(E_1)}{P(E_2)}
$$

### Binomial Distribution

**B** - **binary**

**I** - **independent**

**N** - fixed **number** of trials

**S** - probability success for each trial remains the **same**

$$
_nC_k = {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

$$
P(x=k)={n \choose k} \times p^k \times (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

- k - number of successes
- n - number of trials
- p - probability of success

$$
\mu=n p \ \ \text{and} \ \ \sigma = \sqrt{n p (1-p)}
$$

### 10% Rule

The 10 percent rule is used to approximate the independence of trials where sampling is taken without replacement, If the sample size is less than 10% of the population size, then the trial size can be treated as independent even if it’s not.

$$
Bin(n,p)\approx \mathcal{N}(\mu=np,\sigma=\sqrt{np(1-p)})
$$

a rule of thumb: n needs to be so large that the expected number of successes and failures are both at least 10

$$
np\geq10 \ \ and \ \ n(1-p)\geq10
$$

### Fundamental Counting Principle

states that if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways for each at the occurrences of the first event then the first event and second event can occur in $m \times n$ ways

### Permutation

ordered sequences of objects in which each possible object occurs at most once but not all objects need to be used. The total number of permutations when selecting k objects from a total of n choice is:

$$
_nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

### Normal Distribution

$$
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

### Simple Random Sample

sample is chosen from a given in such a way as to ensure that person (or thing) in a population has an equal of independent chance of being picked for a sample

### Central Limit Theorem

Given a population of values with no specify distribution and a sample size of $N$ that is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of means for samples drawn from this population with replacement can be described as follows:

1. Its shape is approximately normal
2. Its mean $\mu_{\bar x}=\mu$
3. Its standard deviation $\ \sigma_{\bar x}=\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} \$ , also called the standard error

Large Sample Condition:

- original distribution is approximately normal
- sample size greater than 30

### Population Proportion

population proportion - $P$

sample proportion - $\hat p$

$$
\hat p = \frac{\text{count of successes}}{\text{number drawn}}=\frac{X}{n}
$$

### Sampling Distribution of a Sample Proportion

Choose a simple random sample of size $n$ from a population of size $N$, with a proportion of $p$ successes. Then:

- the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to $p$, aka. $\mu_{\hat p}=p$

- standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat p$, aka. $\sigma_{\hat p}=\sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}} $  as long as $ n \leq \dfrac{1}{10} N$

- as $n$ increases the sampling distribution approaches normal as long as
$np \geq 10 \ \text{and} \ n(1-p) \geq 10$

### Sampling Distribution of $\bar x$

Suppose $\bar x$ is the mean of a simple random sample of size $n$ drawn from a large population $N$ with mean $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. As long as $n \leq \dfrac{1}{10} N$

- $\mu_{\bar x}= \mu$
- $\sigma_{\bar x} = \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

Point estimate is the statistic calculated from your sample.

1. don’t expect point estimator $\bar x$ to be the mean
2. should be part of the normal distribution
3. $95\%$ of the data is within 2 standard deviation of the mean
4. Whenever $\bar x$ is within 10 points of $\mu$, $\mu$ is within 10 points of $\bar x$, this happens in about $95\%$ of all samples

### Definition of Confidence Interval, Margin of Error, Confidence Level

A $C\%$ confidence interval gives an interval of plausible values for a parameter

$$
\text{point estimate} \pm \text{margin of error}
$$

$$
\text{margin of error} \rightarrow \text{value based on desired confidence level}
$$

$$
\text{Standard Error}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

|  | proportion | mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **population** |  |  |
| parameter | $p$ | $\mu$ |
| **sample** |  |  |
| statistic | $\hat p$ | $\bar x$ |
| standard deviation | $\sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}\approx \sqrt{\dfrac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$ | $\sigma_{\bar x}=\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\approx \dfrac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}$ |

### Confidence Level

The confidence level $C$ gives the overall success rate of the method for calculating the confidence interval. That is in $C\%$ of all possible samples of a particular size $n$. This method would yield an interval that captures the true parameter value.

Interval yields plausible values.

Generally we chose a confidence level of $90\%$. $95\%$ is most common.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{confidence interval} &= \text{statistics} \pm \text{ME} \\
&= \text{statistic} \pm (\text{critical value}) \times \text{SE}
\end{aligned}
$$

confidence interval for $p$:

$$
\hat p \pm z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$

confidence interval for means:

$$
\bar x \pm z^* \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx \bar x \pm t \times \frac{s_{\bar x}}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### T Distribution

- As degree of freedom increase, approaches standard normal curve
- symmetric mean centered around normal
- standard deviation changes
- bell curve
- unimodal
- $\text{degree of freedom}=n-1$

## Significance Test

### Null and Alternative Hypothesis

$\mathcal{H}_0$ - a claim

$\mathcal{H}_a$ - alternative hypothesis, which means $\mathcal{H}_0$ is false

Parameter of interest $p$ is the true proportion of successes

Statistical test weigh evidence against a claim and an alternate claim

- Step 1: state hypothesis, hypothesis should express suspicions we have before we see the data
    - one sided $>$ or $<$
    - two sided $\neq$

    $$
    \mathcal{H}_0: p = \text{value} \ \ \text{or} \ \ \mathcal{H}_a:p < (> \text{or} \neq) \ \text{value}
    $$

    $$
    \mathcal{H}_0: \mu = \text{value} \ \ \text{or} \ \ \mathcal{H}_a:\mu < (> \text{or} \neq) \ \text{value}
    $$

- Step 2: Does the data give convincing evidence against the null?
    - Reject the null
    - Fail to reject the null

### P-Value

The probability computed assuming $\mathcal{H}_0$ is true that the statistic (such as $\hat p$ or $\bar x$) would take a value as extreme as or more extreme than the one actually observed in the direction of $\mathcal{H}_a$.

Small p-values are evidence against $\mathcal{H}_0$ observed result is unlikely to occur when $\mathcal{H}_0$ is true.

If the p-value is smaller than $\alpha$ we say result are statistically significant at a level of $\underline \alpha$ (significant level), we reject the $\mathcal{H}_0$ and conclude convincing evidence in favor of $\mathcal{H}_a$.

Levels of $\alpha$: $0.01,0.05, 0.1$

|  | $\mathcal{H}_0$ true | $\mathcal{H}_0$ false |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reject $\mathcal{H}_0$ | Type $\text{I}$ error $=\alpha$ | 😀 |
| fail to reject $\mathcal{H}_0$ | 😀 | Type $\text{II}$ error $= 1-\beta$ |

### Test about a population proportion (1-prop z-test)

1. state what parameter of interest is
2. check conditions
    - random - SRS / well-designed condition
    - independence - if not replacing $n\leq \frac{1}{10}N$
    - normal - $np \geq 10 \ \text{and} \ n(1-p) \geq 10$
3. perform the test
    - test statistic:$normalcdf(\text{z-score},\text{upper/lower bound}, mean, \text{standard deviation})$
    - p-value
4. conclude
    - compare p-value to $\alpha$
    - reject or fail to reject in context

### 1 sample t-test

1. State parameter of interest
2. Check conditions
    - random - SRS / well-designed condition
    - independent - 10% or less of N is sampling if without replacement
    - normal - $\geq30$ / population distribution is normal
3. Hypothesis: $\mathcal{H}_0 \ \text{and} \ \mathcal{H}_a$
4. perform the test
    - test statistic:

    $$
    \frac{\text{stats} - \text{parameter}}{\text{standard error}}=\frac{\bar x - \mu_0}{s_x / \sqrt{n}}=t
    $$

5. Conclusion

### Power

The power of a test against a specific alternative is the probability that the test will reject $\mathcal{H}_0$ at a chosen significance level $\alpha$ when the specified alternative value of the parameter is true.

1. get value according to $\alpha$ through $\text{invNorm}$
2. find position of the value in the actual distribution

### Effect

Effect size is a quantitative measure of the strength or magnitude of a phenomenon. It tells how large the difference is between groups or how strong the relationship is between variables independent of sample size.

Cohen’s d - means

$$
d=\frac{\bar x_1 - \bar x_2}{s_p} \ \ \text{where} \ \ s_p=\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2+(n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}
$$

$$
d = \begin{cases}
0.2 &\rightarrow \text{small} \\
0.5 &\rightarrow \text{middle} \\
0.8 &\rightarrow \text{large}
\end{cases}
$$

Cohen’s h

$$
h=2 \arcsin{\sqrt{p_1}} - 2 \arcsin{\sqrt{p_2}}
$$

possible values: $-\pi \ \text{and} \ \pi$

## Sampling Distribution of difference of two groups

| Population of treatment | Parameter | statistic | sample size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $\mu_1$ | $\bar x_1$ | $n_1$ |
| 2 | $\mu_2$ | $\bar x_2$ | $n_2$ |

Sampling distribution of $\bar x_1 - \bar x_2$

choose an SRS of size $n_1$ from a population with mean $\mu_1$ and standard deviation $\sigma_1$ and an SRS of size $n_2$ from a population with mean $\mu_2$ and standard deviation $\sigma_2$

- shape - approximately normal if sample size is large enough
- center -  $\bar x = \bar x_1 - \bar x_2 = \mu_1 - \mu_2$
- spread - $s = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$

$$
t_{stats} = \frac{(\bar x_1 - \bar x_2) - (\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{s_1^2 / n_1 + s_2^2 / n_2}}
$$

### Confidence Interval

$$
\text{confidence interval} = (\bar x_1 - \bar x_2) \pm t^* \times \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

### 2 samples t-test

- $\mathcal{H}_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \ \ \text{or} \ \ \mu_1=\mu_2$
- $\mathcal{H}_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > (< \text{or} \neq) \ 0 \ \ \text{or} \ \ \mu_1> (< \text{or} \neq) \ \mu_2$
